<h1>Railway</h1>
<p>This tag includes all kinds of railways ranging from heavily used 
mainline railways to an abandoned rail line. See the page titled Railways for an introduction on its usage.
</p>
<p>[<b>railway</b>=<b>abandoned</b>]<br>The course of a former railway which has been abandoned and the 
track and infrastucture removed. The course may be still recognized 
through embankments, cuttings, bridges, tunnel and rolling or straight 
ways.</p>
<p>[<b>railway</b>=<b>construction</b>]<br>Railway under construction.</p>
<p>[<b>railway</b>=<b>disused</b>]<br>A section of railway which is no longer used but where the track and infrastructure remains in place.</p>
<p>[<b>railway</b>=<b>funicular</b>]<br>Cable driven inclined railways on a steep slope, with a pair of cars connected by one cable</p>
<p>[<b>railway</b>=<b>light_rail</b>]<br>A higher-standard tram system, normally in its own right-of-way. 
Often it connects towns and thus reaches a considerable length (tens of 
kilometers).</p>
<p>[<b>railway</b>=<b>miniature</b>]<br>Miniature railways
 are narrower than narrow gauge and carry passengers, frequently at an 
exact scale of "standard-sized" rail (for example "1/4 scale").  They 
can often be found in parks.</p>
<p>[<b>railway</b>=<b>monorail</b>]<br>A railway with only a single rail. A monorail can run above the rail like in Las Vegas and Disneyland or can suspend below the rail like the Wuppertal Schwebebahn (Germany).</p>
<p>[<b>railway</b>=<b>narrow_gauge</b>]<br>Narrow-gauge passenger or freight trains. Narrow gauge railways can have mainline railway service like the Rhaetian Railway in Switzerland or can be a small light industrial railway. Use gauge=* to specify the actual width of rails in mm.</p>
<p>[<b>railway</b>=<b>preserved</b>]<br>A railway running historic trains, usually a tourist attraction. Using railway:preserved=yes is an alternate method to mark railway as preserved.</p>
<p>[<b>railway</b>=<b>rail</b>]<br>Full sized passenger or freight trains in the standard gauge for the country or state.</p>
<p>[<b>railway</b>=<b>subway</b>]<br>A city passenger rail service running mostly grade separated (see Wikipedia:rapid transit).  Often a significant portion of the line or its system/network is underground.</p>
<p>[<b>railway</b>=<b>tram</b>]<br>One or two carriage rail vehicles, usually sharing motor road, sometimes called "street running" (Other languages).</p>
<p>[<b>bridge</b>=<b>yes</b>]<br>If the railway goes over a street, waterway or other railway on an elevated structure.</p>
<p>[<b>cutting</b>=<b>yes</b>]<br>A section where the railway is significantly lower than ground level, but not underground.</p>
<p>[<b>electrified</b>=<b>contact_line railyesno</b>]<br>contact_line: a power line over the train headrail: a third rail near the track supplying the train with poweryes: electrified track, but no details availableno: track with no power supply.</p>
<p>[<b>embankment</b>=<b>yes</b>]<br>A section where the railway is raised significantly higher than ground level</p>
<p>[<b>embedded_rails</b>=<b>yes/<type of railway></b>]<br>Specifies that a highway on which non-railway traffic is also 
allowed has railway tracks embedded in it but the rails are mapped as 
separate ways.</p>
<p>[<b>frequency</b>=<b>number [Hz]</b>]<br>The frequency with which a line is electrified. Use 0 for DC. Also see the voltage tag.</p>
<p>[<b>railway:track_ref</b>=<b>number</b>]<br>Track number</p>
<p>[<b>service</b>=<b>crossover</b>]<br>Relatively short lengths of track which switch traffic from one parallel line to another</p>
<p>[<b>service</b>=<b>siding</b>]<br>Relatively short lengths of track, running parallel to (and connected to) a main route</p>
<p>[<b>service</b>=<b>spur</b>]<br>Relatively short lengths of track, built to give one company or entity access to a main or branch line.</p>
<p>[<b>service</b>=<b>yard</b>]<br>Tracks within railway company operated marshaling or maintenance yards.</p>
<p>[<b>tunnel</b>=<b>yes</b>]<br>If the railway goes below ground. Most subways have this tag</p>
<p>[<b>tracks</b>=<b>number</b>]<br>Number of parallel tracks in close proximity when mapped as one single way representing all tracks. If not given means unknown
 and defaults to 1. In many parts of the world the tracks are being 
drawn out separately so that there is more detail, in which case this 
tag isn't used.</p>
<p>[<b>usage</b>=<b>mainbranchfreightindustrialmilitarytourism</b>]<br>main line: heavy trafficbranch line: connecting places with a mainlinefreight: freight service onlyindustrial:  servicing large plants (iron, chemical etc.), surface mining, â€¦military: servicing military area tourism: most mountain rails (rack-rails, funicular) and preserved railways.</p>
<p>[<b>voltage</b>=<b>number</b>]<br>The voltage with which a line is electrified. Also see the frequency tag.</p>
<p>[<b>railway</b>=<b>halt</b>]<br>A small station without switches</p>
<p>[<b>public_transport</b>=<b>stop_position</b>]<br>The position on the railway track where the train (its center) stops
 at a platform. This is useful for routing on long platforms where also 
short trains stop and on long platforms where multiple trains stop 
behind each other. See also public_transport=stop_area.</p>
<p>[<b>public_transport</b>=<b>platform</b>]<br>This is parallel to the rail line for showing where the actual 
platforms are. It is also to know where you can change platform and 
enter the station, so use footpaths to connect them. This is really 
useful for routing too. Use only if the platform is served by public 
transport.</p>
<p>[<b>railway</b>=<b>platform</b>]<br>This is parallel to the rail line for showing where the actual 
platforms are. It is also to know where you can change platform and 
enter the station, so use footpaths to connect them. This is really 
useful for routing too. Use in addition to public_transport=platform.</p>
<p>[<b>public_transport</b>=<b>station</b>]<br>Railway passenger only station.</p>
<p>[<b>railway</b>=<b>station</b>]<br>Railway passenger and/or cargo station. Use in addition to public_transport=station.</p>
<p>[<b>railway</b>=<b>subway_entrance</b>]<br>The entrance to a subway station, usually going from surface to underground.</p>
<p>[<b>railway</b>=<b>tram_stop</b>]<br>A tram stop is a place where a passenger can embark / disembark a tram.</p>
<p>[<b>railway</b>=<b>buffer_stop</b>]<br>stops the train at the end of a track. see Buffer_stop.</p>
<p>[<b>railway</b>=<b>derail</b>]<br>a device used to prevent fouling of a rail track by unauthorized movements of trains or unattended rolling stock. See Derail_(railroad).</p>
<p>[<b>railway</b>=<b>crossing</b>]<br>A point where pedestrians may cross.</p>
<p>[<b>railway</b>=<b>level_crossing</b>]<br>A point where rails and roads cross.</p>
<p>[<b>landuse</b>=<b>railway</b>]<br>Ground used around railways and railway-stations.</p>
<p>[<b>railway</b>=<b>signal</b>]<br>Any kind of railway signal.</p>
<p>[<b>railway</b>=<b>switch</b>]<br>Full connections between railways (aka 'points').</p>
<p>[<b>railway</b>=<b>railway_crossing</b>]<br>Crossing rails with no interconnection.</p>
<p>[<b>railway</b>=<b>turntable</b>]<br>These are used for changing the direction that part of a train is pointing in.</p>
<p>[<b>railway</b>=<b>roundhouse</b>]<br>A semicircular building with many stalls for servicing engines.</p>
<p>[<b>railway</b>=<b>traverser</b>]<br>These are used for changing trains between railways. Also known as transfer table.</p>
<p>[<b>railway</b>=<b>wash</b>]<br>A Railroad car wash</p>
<p>[<b>railway</b>=<b>user defined</b>]<br>All commonly used values according to Taginfo</p>
