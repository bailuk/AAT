<h1>Landuse</h1>
<p>This is used to describe the purpose for which an area of land is being used. See the page Landuse for an introduction on its usage.
</p>
<p>[<b>landuse</b>=<b>commercial</b>]<br>Predominantly commerical businesses and their offices. Commercial businesses which sell goods should be catergorised as landuse=retail.
 Commerical businesses can sell services on site and may include private
 Doctor's Surgeries, and those non-government services for mental and 
physical health, such as a Counsellor's or Physiotherapist's practice or
 Veterinary. Government services and businesses should not use this tag.
 Commercial businesses can also include office buildings and business 
parks which have limited interface with the public and sell their 
services either on site, or externally. Commercial businesses have low 
amounts of public foot traffic.</p>
<p>[<b>landuse</b>=<b>construction</b>]<br>A site which is under active development and construction of a 
building or structure, including any purposeful alteration to the land 
or vegetation upon it. Abandoned construction projects and sites should 
not use this tag.</p>
<p>[<b>landuse</b>=<b>industrial</b>]<br>Predominantly industrial landuses such as workshops, factories, or warehouses.</p>
<p>[<b>landuse</b>=<b>residential</b>]<br>Land where people reside; predominantly residential detached (single
 houses, grouped dwellings), or attached (apartments, flats, units) 
dwellings. For "Mixed-Use" areas where more than half of the land is 
residential, tag as residential.  See also: Land use and areas of natural land ยง Open questions</p>
<p>[<b>landuse</b>=<b>retail</b>]<br>Predominantly retail businesses such as shops. Retail businesses 
sell physical goods such as food (prepared or grocery), clothing, 
medicine, stationary, appliances, tools, or other similar physical 
items. Retail businesses have high amounts of public foot traffic. 
Retail businesses do not exclusively provide or sell their services. For
 businesses which sell services see landuse=commercial.
Generally a member of the public could freely walk into and access a 
retail business. Retail is a subset of commerical, but should be used 
and treated as mutually exclusive in OpenStreetMap.</p>
