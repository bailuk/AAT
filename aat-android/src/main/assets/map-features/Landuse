<p>This is used to describe the purpose for which an area of land is being used. See the page Landuse for an introduction on its usage.
</p>
<p>[<b>landuse</b>=<b>commercial</b>]<br>Predominantly commercial businesses and their offices. Commercial businesses which sell goods should be categorised as landuse=retail. Commercial businesses can sell services on site and may include private Doctor's Surgeries, and those non-government services for mental and physical health, such as a Counsellor's or Physiotherapist's practice or Veterinary. Government services and businesses should not use this tag. Commercial businesses can also include office buildings and business parks which have limited interface with the public and sell their services either on site, or externally. Commercial businesses have low amounts of public foot traffic.</p>
<p>[<b>landuse</b>=<b>construction</b>]<br>A site which is under active development and construction of a building or structure, including any purposeful alteration to the land or vegetation upon it. Abandoned construction projects and sites should not use this tag.</p>

<p>[<b>landuse</b>=<b>industrial</b>]<br>Predominantly industrial landuses such as workshops, factories, or warehouses.</p>
<p>[<b>landuse</b>=<b>residential</b>]<br>Land where people reside; predominantly residential detached (single houses, grouped dwellings), or attached (apartments, flats, units) dwellings. For "Mixed-Use" areas where more than half of the land is residential, tag as residential.  See also: Land use and areas of natural land § Open questions</p>
<p>[<b>landuse</b>=<b>retail</b>]<br>Predominantly retail businesses such as shops. Retail businesses sell physical goods such as food (prepared or grocery), clothing, medicine, stationary, appliances, tools, or other similar physical items. Retail businesses have high amounts of public foot traffic. Retail businesses do not exclusively provide or sell their services. For businesses which sell services see landuse=commercial.
