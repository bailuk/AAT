<h1>Addresses</h1>
<p>This is used to provide postal information for a building or facility. See the pages titled Addresses and addr=* for an introduction on its usage.
</p>
<p>[<b>addr:housenumber</b>=<b>user defined</b>]<br>The house number (may contain letters, dashes or other characters). Addresses describes ways to tag a single building with multiple addresses. Please do not only tag addr:housenumber=*, but also add at least addr:street=* or addr:place=* for places without streets (or map the belonging to a street with a relation using associatedStreet relation or street relation.)</p>
<p>[<b>addr:housename</b>=<b>user defined</b>]<br>The name of a house. This is sometimes used in some countries like England instead of (or in addition to) a house number.</p>
<p>[<b>addr:flats</b>=<b>user defined</b>]<br>The unit numbers (a range or a list) of the flats or apartments located behind a single entrance door.</p>
<p>[<b>addr:conscriptionnumber</b>=<b>user defined</b>]<br>This special kind of housenumber relates to a settlement instead of a
 street. Conscription numbers were introduced in the Austrio-Hungarian 
Empire and are still in use in some parts of Europe, sometimes together 
with street-related housenumbers which are also called orientation numbers.</p>
<p>[<b>addr:street</b>=<b>user defined</b>]<br>The name of the respective street. A way with highway=* or a square with place=square and the corresponding name should be found nearby. The belonging to a street can alternatively be represented by a associatedStreet relation or street relation. The keys addr:housenumber=* and addr:street=* in principle are the only necessary ones if there are valid border polygons. If you are not sure if it is so, just add addr:city=*, addr:postcode=* and addr:country=*.</p>
<p>[<b>addr:place</b>=<b>user defined</b>]<br>This is part of an address which refers to the name of some territorial zone (usually a place=* like island, square or very small village) instead of a street (highway=*). Should not be used together with addr:street=*.</p>
<p>[<b>addr:postcode</b>=<b>user defined</b>]<br>The postal code of the building/area. Some mappers prefer to use boundary=postal_code</p>
<p>[<b>addr:city</b>=<b>user defined</b>]<br>May not be required if boundary=administrative is used correctly. May or may not be a clone of is_in:city=*
 (in some places the city in the address corresponds to the post office 
that serves the area rather than the actual city, if any, in which the 
building is located)! The name of the city as given in postal addresses 
of the building/area.</p>
<p>[<b>addr:country</b>=<b>user defined</b>]<br>May not be required if boundary=administrative is used correctly. The ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 two letter country code in upper case. Example: "DE" for Germany, "CH" for Switzerland, "AT" for Austria, "FR" for France, "IT" for Italy. Caveat: The ISO 3166-1 code for Great Britain is "GB" and not "UK". See also: is_in:country=*</p>
<p>[<b>addr:full</b>=<b>user defined</b>]<br>Use this for a full-text, often multi-line, address if you find the 
structured address fields unsuitable for denoting the address of this 
particular location. Examples: "Fifth house on the left after the 
village oak, Smalltown, Smallcountry", or addresses using special 
delivery names or codes (possibly via an unrelated city name and post 
code), or PO Boxes. Beware that these strings can hardly be 
parsed by software: "1200 West Sunset Boulevard Suite 110A" is still 
better represented as addr:housenumber=1200 + addr:street=West Sunset Boulevard + addr:flats=Suite 110A.</p>
<p>[<b>addr:hamlet</b>=<b>user defined</b>]<br>The hamlet of the object.</p>
<p>[<b>addr:suburb</b>=<b>user defined</b>]<br>If an address exists several times in a city. You have to add the name of the settlement. See Australian definition of suburb.</p>
<p>[<b>addr:subdistrict</b>=<b>user defined</b>]<br>The subdistrict of the object.</p>
<p>[<b>addr:district</b>=<b>user defined</b>]<br>The district of the object.</p>
<p>[<b>addr:province</b>=<b>user defined</b>]<br>The province of the object. For Canada, uppercase two-letter postal abbreviations (BC, AB, ON, QC, etc.) are used. In Russia a synonym addr:region is widely used</p>
<p>[<b>addr:state</b>=<b>user defined</b>]<br>The state of the object. For the US, uppercase two-letter postal abbreviations (AK, CA, HI, NY, TX, WY, etc.) are used.</p>
<p>[<b>addr:interpolation</b>=<b>all/even/odd/ alphabetic</b>]<br>How to interpolate the house numbers belonging to the way along the respective street. See detailed description.</p>
<p>[<b>addr:interpolation</b>=<b>Number n</b>]<br>Every nth house between the end nodes is represented by the interpolation way.</p>
<p>[<b>addr:inclusion</b>=<b>actual/estimate/potential</b>]<br>Optional tag to indicate the accuracy level of survey used to create the address interpolation way. See detailed description.</p>
