<h1>Name</h1>
<p>The name tag is the primary tag used for naming an Element. See the page titled Names for an introduction on its usage.
</p>
<p>[<b>name</b>=<b>User defined</b>]<br>The common default name. (Note: For disputed areas, please use the 
name as displayed on, e.g., street signs for the name tag. Put all 
alternatives into either localized name tags (e.g., name:tr/name:el) or 
the variants (e.g., loc_name/old_name/alt_name). Thank you.)</p>
<p>[<b>name:<lg></b>=<b>User defined</b>]<br>Name in different language; e.g., name:fr=Londres. Note that all key variants below can use a language suffix. See: Multilingual names.</p>
<p>[<b>name:left and  name:right</b>=<b>User defined</b>]<br>Used when a way has different names for different sides (e.g., a street that's forming the boundary between two municipalities).</p>
<p>[<b>int_name</b>=<b>User defined</b>]<br>International name (note: consider using language specific names instead; e.g., name:en=... - see above – International does not (necessarily) mean English).</p>
<p>[<b>loc_name</b>=<b>User defined</b>]<br>Local name.</p>
<p>[<b>nat_name</b>=<b>User defined</b>]<br>National name.</p>
<p>[<b>official_name</b>=<b>User defined</b>]<br>It has been created for country names but we need a clarification 
for other cases between "name", "int_name", "loc_name" and 
"official_name". Example: official_name=Principat d'Andorra (where "name" is name=Andorra).</p>
<p>[<b>old_name</b>=<b>User defined</b>]<br>Historical/old name.</p>
<p>[<b>reg_name</b>=<b>User defined</b>]<br>Regional name.</p>
<p>[<b>short_name</b>=<b>User defined</b>]<br>should be a recognizable, commonly used short version of the name, 
not a nick name (use alt_name for that), useful for searching 
(recognized by Nominatim).</p>
<p>[<b>sorting_name</b>=<b>User defined</b>]<br>name, used for correct sorting of names — This is only needed when 
sorting names cannot be based only on their orthography (using the 
Unicode Collation Algorithm with collation tables tailored by language 
and script, or when sorted lists of names are including names written in
 multiple languages and/or scripts) but requires ignoring some parts 
such as:
ignoring leading articles, or
lowering the relative importance of first names cited before a last name,
ignoring the generic part of a street name when it occurs before the
 specific name (e.g., in French with "rue", "boulevard", "place", etc.),
all of them being ignored at the primary sort level and not easily inferable by a preprocessing algorithm.</p>
<p>[<b>alt_name</b>=<b>User defined</b>]<br>Alternative name by which the feature is known. If there is a name 
that does not fit in any of the above keys, alt_name can be used, e.g., name=Field Fare Road and alt_name=Fieldfare Road, or name=University Centre and alt_name=Grad Pad. In rare cases, the key is used for multiple semicolon-separated names, e.g. alt_name=name1;name2;name3, but this usage is not preferred.</p>
<p>[<b>name_1,  name_2, ...</b>=<b></b>]<br>Do not use this tag, suffixed name tagging for multiple values is deprecated.</p>
