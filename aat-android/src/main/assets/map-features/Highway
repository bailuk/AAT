<h1>Highway</h1>
<p>This is used to describe roads and footpaths. For an introduction on its usage see the page titled Highways. See the page titled Restrictions for an introduction on access limitations by vehicles type, time, day, load and purpose, etc.
</p>
<p>[<b>highway</b>=<b>motorway</b>]<br>A restricted access major divided highway, normally with 2 or more 
running lanes plus emergency hard shoulder. Equivalent to the Freeway, 
Autobahn, etc..</p>
<p>[<b>highway</b>=<b>trunk</b>]<br>The most important roads in a country's system that aren't motorways. (Need not necessarily be a divided highway.)</p>
<p>[<b>highway</b>=<b>primary</b>]<br>The next most important roads in a country's system. (Often link larger towns.)</p>
<p>[<b>highway</b>=<b>secondary</b>]<br>The next most important roads in a country's system. (Often link towns.)</p>
<p>[<b>highway</b>=<b>tertiary</b>]<br>The next most important roads in a country's system. (Often link smaller towns and villages)</p>
<p>[<b>highway</b>=<b>unclassified</b>]<br>The least important through roads in a country's system – i.e. minor
 roads of a lower classification than tertiary, but which serve a 
purpose other than access to properties. (Often link villages and 
hamlets.)
The word 'unclassified' is a historical artefact of the UK road system and does not mean that the classification is unknown; you can use highway=road for that.</p>
<p>[<b>highway</b>=<b>residential</b>]<br>Roads which serve as an access to housing, without function of connecting settlements. Often lined with housing.</p>
<p>[<b>highway</b>=<b>motorway_link</b>]<br>The link roads (sliproads/ramps) leading to/from a motorway from/to a
 motorway or lower class highway. Normally with the same motorway 
restrictions.</p>
<p>[<b>highway</b>=<b>trunk_link</b>]<br>The link roads (sliproads/ramps) leading to/from a trunk road from/to a trunk road or lower class highway.</p>
<p>[<b>highway</b>=<b>primary_link</b>]<br>The link roads (sliproads/ramps) leading to/from a primary road from/to a primary road or lower class highway.</p>
<p>[<b>highway</b>=<b>secondary_link</b>]<br>The link roads (sliproads/ramps) leading to/from a secondary road from/to a secondary road or lower class highway.</p>
<p>[<b>highway</b>=<b>tertiary_link</b>]<br>The link roads (sliproads/ramps) leading to/from a tertiary road from/to a tertiary road or lower class highway.</p>
<p>[<b>highway</b>=<b>living_street</b>]<br>For living streets,
 which are residential streets where pedestrians have legal priority 
over cars, speeds are kept very low and where children are allowed to 
play on the street.</p>
<p>[<b>highway</b>=<b>service</b>]<br>For access roads to, or within an industrial estate, camp site, business park, car park etc. Can be used in conjunction with service=* to indicate the type of usage and with access=* to indicate who can use it and in what circumstances.</p>
<p>[<b>highway</b>=<b>pedestrian</b>]<br>For roads used mainly/exclusively for pedestrians in shopping and 
some residential areas which may allow access by motorised vehicles only
 for very limited periods of the day. To create a 'square' or 'plaza' 
create a closed way and tag as pedestrian and also with area=yes.</p>
<p>[<b>highway</b>=<b>track</b>]<br>Roads for mostly agricultural or forestry uses. To describe the quality of a track, see tracktype=*. Note: Although tracks
 are often rough with unpaved surfaces, this tag is not describing the 
quality of a road but its use. Consequently, if you want to tag a 
general use road, use one of the general highway values instead of track.</p>
<p>[<b>highway</b>=<b>bus_guideway</b>]<br>A busway where the vehicle guided by the way (though not a railway) 
and is not suitable for other traffic. Please note: this is not a normal
 bus lane, use access=no, psv=yes instead!</p>

ramps, or truck arrester beds. It enables vehicles with braking failure 
to safely stop.</p>

<p>[<b>highway</b>=<b>road</b>]<br>A road/way/street/motorway/etc. of unknown type. It can stand
 for anything ranging from a footpath to a motorway. This tag should 
only be used temporarily until the road/way/etc. has been properly 
surveyed. If you do know the road type, do not use this value, instead use one of the more specific highway=* values.</p>
<p>[<b>highway</b>=<b>footway</b>]<br>For designated footpaths; i.e., mainly/exclusively for pedestrians. 
This includes walking tracks and gravel paths. If bicycles are allowed 
as well, you can indicate this by adding a bicycle=yes tag.  Should not be used for paths where the primary or intended usage is unknown. Use highway=pedestrian for pedestrianised roads in shopping or residential areas and highway=track if it is usable by agricultural or similar vehicles.</p>
<p>[<b>highway</b>=<b>bridleway</b>]<br>For horse riders. Equivalent to highway=path + horse=designated.</p>
<p>[<b>highway</b>=<b>steps</b>]<br>For flights of steps (stairs) on footways. Use with step_count=* to indicate the number of steps</p>

<p>[<b>cycleway</b>=<b>track</b>]<br>A track provides a route that is separated from traffic. In the 
United States, this term is often used to refer to bike lanes that are 
separated from lanes for cars by pavement buffers, bollards, parking 
lanes, and curbs. Note that a cycle track may alternatively be drawn as a separate way next to the road which is tagged as highway=cycleway.</p>
<p>[<b>cycleway</b>=<b>opposite_track</b>]<br>Used on ways with oneway=yes that have a cycling track going the opposite direction of normal traffic flow. Used together with oneway:bicycle=no.</p>

 lane). Used together with oneway:bicycle=no.</p>
<p>[<b>cycleway</b>=<b>shared_lane</b>]<br>Cyclists share a lane with motor vehicles, but there are markings
